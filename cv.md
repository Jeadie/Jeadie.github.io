## Professional Experience
### Engineering Lead, Marqo, Oct 2022-Present (6 mos)
- Directed and led the maturation of cloud infrastructure and processes (containerization, testing, CI/CD, and development tooling) for a small team of 4-5 engineers.
- Within my first week, I unblocked the onboarding of our first Marqo Cloud customer by leading the deployment and performance testing of our storage layer on highly available Kubernetes clusters.
- Designed and built the Marqo Cloud control plane, responsible for managing and provisioning the cell-based architecture used in the data plane for reliability and horizontal scaling, as well as automatic provisioning and scaling during account onboarding. The control plane handled a mix of container, Kubernetes, and AWS IaC integrations.
- Improved the system design of Marqo Cloud to meet vertical scaling requirements essential for winning enterprise customers.
- Designed and built training and fine-tuning infrastructure for LLMs in use to improve search relevancy (to be open-sourced soon).
- Redesigned and reimplemented core data plane microservices from Python for performance reasons.

### Software Engineer, Amazon, Mar 2021-Oct 2022 (1 yr 8 mos)
- Worked on Amazon Grocery's data and recommendation systems for substitutions/replacements.

- Diagnosed and fixed the event streaming, ETL and statistical model pipeline responsible for grocery substitution recommendations leading to a $80MM revenue recovery. Became the SME in this area and proposed new approaches to improve content-based filtering for new or out-of-distributions SKUs.

- Built out CI/CD and infrastructure code for opensearch clusters to safely deploy our observability platform and make changes to the system. Systemised telemetry agents to reduce code duplication and errors. Reduced telemetry bloat and improved infrastructure configuration saving 30% on cloud costs. Introduced distributed tracing across substitution-based microservices for improved observability.

- Delivered paid substitutions across Amazon Fresh stores as a part of a multi-team/organisation. Responsible for leading work on away team systems. Designed and delivered improved systems to simplify the service architecture across grocery fullfilment systems. 

- Delivered production systems to enable CCPA and GDPR compliance across grocery substitution data.

- Automated and deployed AI training infrastructure using Kubernetes and other containerisation tooling across both Google Cloud and AWS.◦
- Responsible for internal and production infrastructure, release automation and site reliability across the product within multiple environments that require medical regulatory compliance.◦
- Improved CI/CD tooling for developer efficiency including browser testing, build times and system tooling.
- Implemented batch and distributed data pipelines for processing DICOMs with Apache Beam Google Dataflow.
- Researched and developed deep learning models in Tensorflow for MRI bias correction, modality transfer learning prostate cancer classification including reviewing and experimentally assessing new literature.
- Developed features for Django backend including multi-factor authentication and automated HL7 integration
- Developed features for React.js frontend applications including dynamically generated questionnaires

### Junior Programmer, UQ Queensland Brain Institute, Mar 2017-Apr 2018 (1 yr 2 mos)
