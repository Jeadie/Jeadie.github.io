# ðŸ‘‹ I am Jack Eadie

## Now: building neural search at [Marqo.ai](https://www.marqo.ai/)


## Past
I spent ~18 months within Amazon's grocery org (think Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh). I worked on improving the recommendations we give when groceries aren't in-stock and shipped features to alleviate the customer experience if/when it occurs.

Before that, I spent nearly 3 years working at [MaxwellPlus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maxwell-plus). We did some awesome work (see [[1]](https://cloud.google.com/customers/maxwell-plus/) & [[2]](https://nhsaccelerator.com/innovation/maxwell-plus/)) rethinking how urologists can use AI with telehealth support to scale and improve the outcomes of prostate cancer screening. I spent time on and learnt a bunch here doing ML research, ML & data engineering, infrastructure and tooling.

I studied both mathematics and software engineering at [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I enjoyed pure mathematics and wish I did more.
