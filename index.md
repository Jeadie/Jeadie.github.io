## Now
Iâ€™m working in engineering at [Spice ai](https://www.spice.ai/), we're building [spice](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai), a unified SQL query interface to locally accelerate and query data tables sourced from any database, data warehouse, or data lake. Built with Rust and modern data tooling: Apache Flight, Apache Datafusion, DuckDB and more!

I also focus on the AI building blocks & infrastructure for the Spice platform. Think: training pipelines, inference (server & on the edge), understanding the industry & technical SOTA time-series ML, and designing an intuitive & powerful developer experience. 

## Past
I led & built the managed cloud service for [Marqo.ai](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo), from onboarding our very first customer to our first public, enterprise customer. 

I spent ~18 months within Amazon's grocery org (think Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh). I worked on improving the recommendations we give when groceries aren't in-stock and shipped features to alleviate the customer experience if/when it occurs.

Before that, I spent nearly 3 years working at [MaxwellPlus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maxwell-plus). We did some awesome work (see [[1]](https://cloud.google.com/customers/maxwell-plus/) & [[2]](https://nhsaccelerator.com/innovation/maxwell-plus/)) rethinking how urologists can use AI with telehealth support to scale and improve the outcomes of prostate cancer screening. I spent time on and learnt a bunch here doing ML research, ML & data engineering, infrastructure and tooling.

I studied both mathematics and software engineering at [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I enjoyed pure mathematics and wish I did more.
