## Now
Working on [spice](https://www.spiceai.org) for [Spice ai](https://www.spice.ai/). Spice makes it easy for developers to create production-ready, AI-native data applications.

## Past
I led & built the managed cloud service for [Marqo.ai](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo), from onboarding our very first customer to our first public, enterprise customer.

I spent 18 months at Amazon improving the recommendations we give for groceries when they're out of stock.

Before that, I spent nearly 3 years working at [MaxwellPlus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maxwell-plus). We did some awesome work (see [[1]](https://cloud.google.com/customers/maxwell-plus/) & [[2]](https://nhsaccelerator.com/innovation/maxwell-plus/)) leveraging AI and software to maximise Urologist leverage and improve prostate cancer screening outcomes. I spent time on and learnt a bunch here doing ML research, ML & data engineering, infrastructure and tooling.

I studied both mathematics and software engineering at [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I enjoyed pure mathematics and wish I did more.
