# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Now
- Building tensor search at [Marqo.ai](marqo.ai).

### Past
- 18 months at Amazon working on groceries (think Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh), improving recommendations and the customer impact of when groceries are out of stock.

- ~ 3 years working at [MaxwellPlus](https://www.maxwellplus.com/), where we did some awesome work (see [[1]](https://cloud.google.com/customers/maxwell-plus/) & [[2]](https://nhsaccelerator.com/innovation/maxwell-plus/)). I spent my time across AI research, ML + data engineering and infrastructure + devops.

- I studied both mathematics (mainly pure) + software engineering at UQ. I wish I did even more math.
