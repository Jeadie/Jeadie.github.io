Personal page for me, jeadie.

## Overview
A rather standard, boilerplate, Jekyll project to host my website + blog. The third rewrite of my website: 
1. A simple Bootstrap website to learn and experiment with basic Web concepts and design principles.
2. React website to try out react.
3. Jekyll website to hopefully reduce the upkeep and maintenance demands and allow me to focus on other experiments with my (limited) spare time. 

The directory structure is simple (as it is a small project):


## Requirements
- ruby>=2.5.3
- jekyll>=3.8.5
- bundler

## Development
To build and serve locally: 
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
