These are my [Reading Notes](https://www.notion.so/Reading-Notes-11241d9832c84507a85519bc53170eaf) for everything online (at least anything I read on my computer). This is the introduction I included in the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) page: 

> This is a list of articles, essays or papers that, when I began to read found something I wanted to keep for later; quotes or ideas or questions or potential reframes. Thus, they represent some of the more interesting online written word that i encounter. In an effort to slow down and properly synthesis and reflect on such sparsely distributed gems, I have created this anthology. 

I try to keep them up to date.
