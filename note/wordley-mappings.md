# Overview
 - Most business strategies are backwards causality. X has success, and does A, B & C. If we, Y, do A, B & C, we will be successful.
 - Even if these factors are correct, Y is contextual (as is success), and generally overdetermined.
 - Companies lack situational awareness and therefore duplicating strategies from successful companies is ineffective. 


- Complete DAG of factors (or elements of the business) affecting value to a company.
- Rank based on _"value visibility"_, i.e. the explicit, pubilc correlation between the factor's value and how it's percieved by customers.
- Evolution of technology, has stages: 
  1. Genesis
  2. Custom built/bespoke
  3. Product
  4. Commodity
- Partition factors into their stages (e.g. electricity is a commodity, company's app is genesis/bespoke).
- Now we have a map of: 
  - x-axis: technology timeline
  - y-axis : value visibility/customer value
- And we have premises:
  - top-left: where to invest
  - bottom-right: Do not invest
  - Factors/elements move to the right over time (i.e. bespoke factors become standard products).
  - From the above point, top-left continues to be emptied, leading to new genesis opportunities.
- That lead to the conclusion: We have a three part partition from top-left to bottom-right that informs how we should operate: build, buy, outsource.
