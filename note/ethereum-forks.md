title: A history of Ethereum Forks and Upgrades
---

## Overview
Important forks and upgrades, partitioned chronologically. Not all forks, for a full list, see [Ethereum History](https://ethereum.org/en/history).

### Initial Creation
 - November 27, 2013: Original [Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/669c9e2e2027310b6b3cdce6e1c52962/Ethereum_Whitepaper_-_Buterin_2014.pdf)
 - April 1, 2014: Original [Yellowpaper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) (i.e. formal definition).
 - July 22, 2014: First sale of Ether
 - Frontier - July 30, 2015: Initial, basic implementation/testnet
 - Homestead -  March 14, 2016: Protocol upgrades after initial launch, essentially the first true live Ethereum.

### Network Attacks
 - DAO attack fork - July 20, 2016: Hard fork of the chain after the "DAO Attack" which drained 3.6 million ETH from a faulty contract.
 - Tangerine Whistle - October 18, 2016: Initial fork based on sustained DOS attacks. both from bugs in the implementation & specifications, but also a mismatch between Gas fee and the underlying complexity of certain operations.
 - Spurious Dragon - October 22, 2016: Further changes following the attacks mentioned in Tangerine Whistle. 

### L2 Scaling and POS preparation
 - Byzantium - October 16, 2017: Added support for cryptographic methods/primitatives needed for L2 scaling. Also delayed difficulty bomb.
 - Istanbul - December 8, 2019: SNARKs and STARKs performance improvements for L2 scaling. 
 - October 15, 2020: Ethereum contract to enable staking was deployed. 
 - December 1, 2020: Beacon chain started producing blocks (needed 16384 32 ETH stakes)
 - Altair - October 27, 2021: Increase validator penalties and other beacon chain support.
 - Bellatrix - September 6, 2022: All validator penalites supported & updates to fork choice algorithm for validators. 
 - Paris - September 15, 2022: Upgrade and first proof of stake block. 

### Post Paris POS
 - Capella - April 12, 2023: Withdrawal credentials for the beacon chain (i.e. updating where validators can withdraw), and the automatic checking of rewards.
 - Shanghai - April 12, 2023: Allow stakers to withdraw ETH to the execution layer (i.e. back to non-staked ETH).
