# History
 - John Von Neumann and _"The General and Logical Theory of Automata"_. Defined Automaton, suggested the connection to biological life, producing a cellular automaton that were both 1. self replicating and 2. Universal Turing machine.
 - John Conway. Defined a cellular automaton rulset, named _"Game of Life"_ that, after much experimentation, created an interesting balanced state of reproduction and decay
 - Tommaso Toffoli: Proved CAs were reversible, an important condition for the "biological life and nature can be explained by simple rules like CAs".
 - Christopher Langton: Built the first self replicating artificial life on an Apple 2 in 1979. 
 - Stephen Wolfram: Extensive work on one dimensional CAs, including a classification scheme of 1. stabilise into a constant 2. stabilise into repeating patterns 3. evolved into chaos, or 4. produce long term complex dynamics with stable local structures (i.e. artificial life).
