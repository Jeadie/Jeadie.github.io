### How to Become a Magnet for Talent and Assess Talent
- [link](https://delian.io/lessons-5)
_"Summary
- Talk about your startup publicly and loudly so people know what you are working on
- Crawl your personal network for your smartest friends, but after that you need to run a sales process on LinkedIn to get more candidates in the door. Look for potential not experience
- Running a candidate pipeline takes a lot of time, make sure you ratchet up the time you invest based on the likelihood of the candidate being a fit
- Go out and meet with A+ talent so you know what to look for when interviewing
- Look for risk takers and avoid people who are comfortable going down the trodden path and climbing the ladder
- Being an early employee means you will encounter tons of obstacles, look for people willing to run through walls and learn whatever they need to learn
- Remember that there are tons of options out there, you need to sell them on joining you, and sometimes having a talent person in-house can really help with that"_

### How to Hire World-Class Engineers
- [link](https://angel.co/blog/how-to-hire-world-class-engineers)

1. Create a company story that engineers will want to be part of
- Marketing applied to hiring
2. Never stop sourcing
 - _"“Most engineering managers are introverted by nature — that’s true of me and most. You just have to embrace it. It’s not about loving to have coffee with 20 people in two weeks. It’s about that amazingly talented person that you’re eventually going to work with.”"_
  - Sources
    1. Platforms: Fast, reliable, expensive (?).
    2. Referrals: Human trusted recommendations at the risk of homogeneity
    3. Prospecting: Strong/selected candidate quality, takes significant time.
    4. Inbound Marketing (see 1. ): Long time horizon 

3. Build relationships before screening
4. Focused, relevant onsites
5. Close Quickly
    - Discuss compensation openly
    - Open communication channel, even text.


### The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing - Joel Spolsky (StackOverflow co-founder)
- [link](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/)
- Out of all decisions to the success of a project, personal is perhaps the only important factor (scenario with fixed project, timelines, etc)
- 6 people with them, 5 who would be immediate co-workers/managers
    - 2/6 no hire == no hire
- _"And in the middle, you have a large number of “maybes” who seem like they might just be able to contribute something. The trick is telling the difference between the superstars and the maybes, because the secret is that you don’t want to hire any of the maybes. Ever."_
- _"On the other hand, if you reject a good candidate, I mean, I guess in some existential sense an injustice has been done, but, hey, if they’re so smart, don’t worry, they’ll get lots of good job offers."_
- _"1. Smart, and  2. Get things done. That's it."_
- _"People who are Smart but don’t Get Things Done often have PhDs and work in big companies where nobody listens to them because they are completely impractical. They would rather mull over something academic about a problem rather than ship on time._
- _"Blowhards hire everyone; they think that the candidate must be smart because 'he thinks so much like me!'"_
- What should you look for during the open ended questions?
 1. Passion
 2. Explain things well
 3. Took on leadership roles
     - _"The only way you’re going to be able to tell if somebody Gets Things Done is to see if historically they have tended to get things done in the past."_

An interesting side point explaining how it feels/why it happens when you lose understand of a discussion based on lack of knowledge: 
_"Even though I understand all the little bits, I can’t understand them fast enough to get the big picture."_. A deeper understanding of an area lets for faster communication, and discussing/reasoning up & down the abstraction stack.


- Technical Question / Coding
 1. Simple easy questions. Speed as a predictor of ability. 
 2. Recursion and pointers.
_"I want my ER doctor to understand anatomy, even if all she has to do is put the computerized defibrillator nodes on my chest and push the big red button, and I want programmers to know programming down to the CPU level, even if Ruby on Rails does read your mind and build a complete Web 2.0 social collaborative networking site for you with three clicks of the mouse."_
_"The optimal time to make a decision about the candidate is about three minutes after the end of the interview."_
