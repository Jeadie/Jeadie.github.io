## Work
I work at [Spice AI](spice.ai). I focus on the AI building blocks & infrastructure for the Spice platform.

Think training pipelines, inference (server & on the edge), understanding the SOTA for time series ML in academia and industry, and designing an intuitive & powerful developer experience.

## Everything else
I read alot. I'm trying to study all the mathematics I missed at university (right now topology and differential manifolds). Otherwise, I run and play the cello.
